                <li>Purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interest through creative expressions</li>
                <li><strong>Program</strong>: A collection of program statements that perform a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software</li>

                <li>Behavior of a program is how program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it</li>
                <li>Program inputs: Data sent to a computer, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text</li>
                <li>Event: Associated with an action and supplies input data to a program</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Basic Processes (According to Collegeboard)
                    <ul class="basic-processes">
                        <li>Investigating and reflecting</li>
                        <li>Designing</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Development Process</strong>: Requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. Basically, you are repeatedly checking the program for improvements</li>
                <li><strong>Incremental Development Process</strong>: Breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole</li>
                <li>Design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements</li>
                <li><strong>Program documentation</strong>: Written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program and how it was developed</li>
                <li><strong>Comments</strong>: Form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people and don’t affect how a program runs</li>
                <li><strong>Programmers should always document a program</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helps maintain correct programs</li>
                        <li>Not all languages support comments so other methods of documentation may be required</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source</li>

            <h3>1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logic error</strong>: Mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Logic error is often mistaken with other errors. Logic error does not break the program; it is when a program output is incorrect. Ex: 2 + 2 = 5</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Syntax error</strong>: Mistake in a program where the rules of the programming languages are not followed. Ex. <code>pritn("Hello world")</code></li>
                <li><strong>Run-time error</strong>: Mistake in the program during the execution of a program.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ex: You want to find the 5th index of the string, but the string only has 4 characters. It will give you a run-time (IndexOutOfBounds) error.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Overflow error</strong>: An error that occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is outside the defined range
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ex: If you put a very large number (1000…….0000) the program will cause this error. Usually languages have a 32-bit limit on integers but you don’t need to know this (2147483648)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Effective ways to handle errors
                    <ul>
                        <li>Test cases, hand tracing, visualizations, debuggers, adding extra output statements</li>
                    </ul>

            <p>
                Most of the concepts in this unit are intuitive and most questions can be solved using common sense (This is probably the easiest unit btw). I mean you obviosuly know that a program is code run by a computer to do tasks or something. Some specific topics that are very likely to be on the exam:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Computing Innovation</li>

                    <li>(B) Program documentation is only needed for programs in development; it is not needed after a program is completed.</li>
                    <li>(C) Program documentation is useful when programmers collaborate but not when a programmer works individually on a project.</li>
                    <li>(D) Program documentation is useful during initial program development and also when modifications are made to existing programs.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <div class="question">
                <p>A computer program uses 3 bits to represent integers. When the program adds the decimal (base 10) numbers 5 and 3, the result is 0. Which of the following is the best explanation for the result?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(A) An overflow error occurred.</li>

            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <div class="question">
                <p>Historically, it has been observed that computer processing speeds tend to double every two years. Which of the following best describes how technology companies can use this observation for planning purposes?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(A) Technology companies can accurately predict the dates when new computing innovations will be available to use.</li>
                    <li>(B) Technology companies can plan to double the costs of new products each time advances in processing speed occur.</li>
                    <li>(C) Technology companies can set research and development goals based on anticipated processing speeds.</li>
                    <li>(D) Technology companies can spend less effort developing new processors because processing speed will always improve at the observed rate.</li>
